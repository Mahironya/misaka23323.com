# Walk Slowly

* $!#^! University, $!#^! campus. An abandoned rehab hut. A shuttered cafeteria. Two places apart, listening for each other in the wind.*

## 1) Wrong Turn

The first time I passed those two places at night, it was because I took a wrong turn.
The wind threaded the gaps between concrete buildings like a sigh that wouldn’t burn out. Near the end of my orthopedics rotation, I cut across from the lab building toward the dorms and drifted into an older quadrant to the south: an **abandoned rehabilitation hut**, and—farther off on a diagonal—a **sealed cafeteria** with a steel roll-down door and a faded *Under Maintenance* sign.

They weren’t connected, and yet when the wind circled, it felt as if they could see one another.

## 2) The Rehab Hut

Dust on the glass door lay like frost; in the moonlight the **parallel bars** and **training steps** looked like waves frozen mid-crest. The latch hadn’t caught. Wind breathed out old disinfectant—the past refusing to disperse. The door tapped the floor—*tick, tick*—a metronome reminding someone: *one step, then another.*

Inside, hope for the human body had been folded into a single narrow room.
A chalk-powdered **wheelchair** waited in the corner, two finger streaks on its rim like thin crescents of moon. A **mirror** faced the bars, scuffed the way glass gets when a person has stroked it for years, checking whether their muscles still obey.

A sticker on the wall read: *“Today, one step more than yesterday.”*
Underfoot a **laminated card** crackled. I lifted it:

> Student Li — *ankle dorsiflexion 20°.*
> *Very good.*

Wind pushed again; the door clicked. In the mirror, I stood alone between the bars, backpack heavy as stone. Then, from the pane’s deeper dark, **a second figure penciled itself in**—a hesitant graphite line. He lifted a foot onto the first stair. Cold climbed my spine like rungs.

I turned. No one. Only the metronome swayed in the draft, counting: *one, two; one, two.*
The chill loosened—pushed aside by something almost tender. Perhaps the stubborn footsteps that once filled this room were contagious; even fear seemed to learn its manners, queueing up to take **two polite steps** forward.

## 3) The Cafeteria

The cafeteria’s shutter hung halfway, the muzzle of an old beast. Beneath *Under Maintenance*, the menu blackboard still dangled, its chalk dust a faint, defeated white. My phone light slid under the seam, catching a row of stainless tables **etched with fine scratches**—days someone tried to buff out.

The air held soured grease and rain-woken rust. I was stepping back when a tiny **ding** rose—metal touching porcelain. Chopsticks kissing a bowl.

Two more taps followed. Careful ones. Someone **gingerly lifting long beans**.

At the beam’s edge a shadow gathered—short and round, an apron tied at the waist. She stood behind the noodle-and-congee window, **ladle in hand**, leaning toward a pot I couldn’t see. The plastic strip curtain chattered in the wind.

“*Auntie?*” I called before I could stop myself.

The shadow paused, **listening**. Then the room fell still again. Only the curtain hissed as if someone had just passed through. My throat tightened, like after hot porridge cools and leaves a numb ache.

## 4) Rain Shelter

I began to pass those places often—not for thrills, but because some sites, though closed, still tried to stand post.

One drizzly night I ducked into the hut to wait out rain. No lights. Raindrops stitched along the eaves—a regiment of needles marching in order. The tiles by the bars were slick with damp; the air held the **cool taste of chalk**. I sat against the wall, backpack for a pillow.

A **soft double knock** tapped the door.

An old man stood there, rain cross-hatching his frame. He leaned on a cane. When he spoke, his breath was thin.

> “Young man, can I still practice here?”

I shifted to make room at the bars, and a cooler thought cut in: the door hadn’t opened; the rain hadn’t crept in; the puddles were unchanged.

He didn’t wait for my answer. His palms **found the bars**, rasping faintly on metal. Cane set aside, he nudged his right foot half a step forward—**a body trying to remember** a move it once owned.

Somewhere the metronome began to count. I didn’t look for it, afraid to jar loose whatever held. He repeated the motion again and again; with each completion the **mirror’s figure sharpened**, like a hand in fog being gripped tighter. Rain thickened; drops slid through the door seam and burst on the tile with small pops.

I remembered the wall: *Today, one step more than yesterday.* My throat went sour.

When I came to, he was gone. Two blurred water marks clung to the bars, as if rain had run from the bend of an arm. I switched off the metronome.

“See you tomorrow,” I said to the empty room.

## 5) Typhoon Night

After a typhoon, campus lost power for hours. Dizzy with hunger, I felt my way toward the vending machine near the old quarter. The shutter rattled like a string of vertebrae.

I was about to skirt it when a **warm scent** struck—ginger’s bright sting, the light sweetness of old rice congee, the lift of scallions. Steam pushed from the seam as if an unseen hand **offered a cupped bowl**.

I pressed my ear to the gap. A **ladle pinged** a pot—**rhythm like a heartbeat**. Footsteps scuffed: rubber soles with a slight drag, as if a person with a bad foot was being clumsy help in the kitchen.

“*Auntie, I’m hungry,*” I whispered.

Inside, a pause. Then the careful clatter of bowls, as if selecting the one without a chip. Something was set on the ground by the shutter. I crouched and felt a warm ceramic bowl—*no idea how it had cleared the gap.*

Congee. A pinch of scallion floating. My sleeves were cold in the wind; my palms jumped with heat. I didn’t sip, afraid tears would fall straight in.

> “*Eat slowly.*”

The voice was soft, like steam thinning. Two words, lighter than wind and heavy enough to still the tremor in my chest. I thanked her, voice shaking. Inside, only blackness—as if the warmth had been an error. But the bowl in my hands was **real and hot**.

I finished and set it back. Napkins skittered like small animals.
Next day, the bowl was gone. In its place: a damp scrap of paper, two lines in a familiar, tremoring hand:

> **Eat well.
> Walk slowly.**

I’d seen that hand on the rehab cards.

## 6) Tokens and Trades

After that I began to **bring things on purpose**.

* For the **hut**: fresh metronome batteries; an unopened pack of gait belts.
* For the **cafeteria**: a small bottle of ginger oil; packets of white pepper.

By morning, something was always “reallocated.” I didn’t ask who. In that **tacit politeness**, fear learned restraint. The wind stayed cold and the shadows long, but the phrase *walk slowly* felt like a hand lifting the strap of my backpack from behind.

Once I found an old **rehab notebook**, cover gone fuzzy, pages crammed with logs. A **meal ticket** was tucked in the center—yellowed:

> *Breakfast: congee + pickles, ¥1.5.*

On the back, two lines:

> *Today I don’t want to eat, but I will.*
> *Today I don’t want to practice, but I will.*

Two narrow roads laid side by side, heading to the same place.

I knew then: the cafeteria and the hut had **kept each other alive**.
The cafeteria taught **warmth** as a way to live.
The hut taught **steps** as a way to keep living.
Time had shelved them in separate corners, but **wind knows paths** and **moonlight remembers**. At night they greeted each other across shrubs and road.

## 7) Before Goodbye

The year I graduated, the school fenced off the old quarter. Renovation, they said—or demolition.

On my last visit I left a final packet of pepper by the shutter and set the metronome to **60**. The corridor of wind stretched long.

> “I’m leaving,” I said.

A pot somewhere seemed to release one **hidden bubble**. The hut’s door **closed by itself**, that familiar, gentle click—more like a quiet *okay* than a lock.

I turned away. The streetlight drew my shadow long, like someone who had just learned how to **go far**. Halfway down the path, the faintest **clink of dishes** reached me—so light it felt like a blessing.

## 8) Elsewhere

I did go far. One dawn after a night shift at another hospital, I watched patients depart, slowly, one by one.

A student aide asked, “Why can some people smile when they’re in so much pain?”

> “Maybe,” I said, “because they’ve heard *walk slowly* a few times.”

I thought of the Dongguan wind, the two abandoned rooms, and the bowl of congee lifted through a shutter gap—hot, ginger-bright, rice-sweet—an unseen hand **patting your back**, then nudging you toward a brighter patch.

Fear doesn’t disappear; it gets **portioned into bites** you can swallow.
Loneliness doesn’t vanish; some nights it becomes the **metronome’s tick**, reminding you:

> *One step, then another.*

People who pass there at night still slow down. I think it’s because they hear it too—the soft tap of a bowl on wood, the mirror’s cool glint from the bars, and the wind running errands between **two distant rooms** that murmur *goodnight* to each other across the road.

And then they know: in a world that can chill you to the bone, **a warm hand is waiting** for you to steady your next step.
